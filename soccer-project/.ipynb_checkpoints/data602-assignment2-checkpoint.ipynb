    "\n",
    "The new trading system will have the same requirements as _assignment 1_ but with the following additional requirements or modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The application will be entirely web-based using Flask or any other Python-based web framework\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The user interface does not need to be attractive but neat, clean and organized. Using a framework like Bootstrap is permissible. If you are going to use a design motif, stick to a “flat” modern theme.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. If you are new to web programming then stick to pure HTML5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blotter data will be persisted into a database. You are free to decide what database what you wish, but a NoSQL database (MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc.) is preferred. You will not lose or gain points for choosing / not choosing a particular database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The universe of equities the trader can choose from will go from 5 to the full set of equities available to trade on the NASD exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/companies-by-industry.aspx?exchange=NASDAQ\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. The data needs to be loaded only once on startup and does not need to be loaded on a recurring basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. After a trader picks a stock to trade and on the entry screen where s/he will enter quantity, display a chart showing the times & sales data of last 100 market trades. The times & sales data can be retrieved, for example for AMZN, from this URL: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amzn/time-sales\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blotter\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The blotter will be persisted in a database and can be cached using data structures\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. The blotter will have a new column called Cash . The cash column will have the net cash balance after the trade represented by that row in the blotter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- P/L\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The P/L data will be stored using pandas DataFrames\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Add a column called “Total P/L” which is the sum of UPL and RPL\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Add a column called Allocation By Shares which is the percentage of shares for this stock over total shares in the whole portfolio\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Add a column called Allocation By Dollars which is the percentage of dollars this position has over total dollars in the market for the whole portfolio\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. For each equity that is about to trade, please produce some analytics for that stock, namely: daily average, daily standard deviation and the range of the price for the last 100 days\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. After the trader selects the stock s/he wishes to trade, display the 100-day trade history chart.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Use any charting library you wish: Matplotlib, D3.js\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Collaboration (except sharing code) for this Visualizations section is allowed as long as it is open to all students to see i.e. on #general or #assignment2 channel or Blackboard forum\n",
